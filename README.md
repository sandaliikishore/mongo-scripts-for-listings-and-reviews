# MongoDB Query Script for Listings and Reviews Collection

This script connects to a MongoDB database (`mongoPractise`) and retrieves information from the `Listings&Reviews` collection. It includes several queries that can be run by uncommenting the desired query in the pipeline.

## Requirements
1. MongoDB server should be running locally or remotely.
2. Python version 3.6+ installed.
3. The `pymongo` library installed:
    ```
    pip install pymongo
    ```

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. **Open the script in Visual Studio Code**:
    - Navigate to the directory containing the script.
    - Open the `script.py` file in VS Code.

3. **Uncomment the desired query**:
    - By default, all queries are commented out in the script.
    - To run a specific query, simply **uncomment** the relevant line(s) in the `pipeline` list by removing the `#` at the beginning of the line(s). Run it on vs code for best performance.
